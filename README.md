## Safea Altef 

I am creating this repository to share my journey of transitioning from social science research methods to data science tools.

My interests include NLP, particularly in Arabic, predictive analystics, big data, large language multi-agent models, LLM mini models, SNA, and data modeling in social science.

Through this repository, I aim to build a portfolio while sharing my experience in acquiring data science tools
